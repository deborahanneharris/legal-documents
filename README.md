Semantic Computing Research
Automatically extracting the patterns of reasoning from exhaustive legal documents can make legal systems more effective
and increase public access to justice. The vital task to achieve this is to automatically classify sentences in legal documents
into categories based on their content. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that breaks down legal documents and
classify the rhetorical types of sentences. We also test out a hypothesis, that using small set of labelled data, we can build
deeper and accurate models for processing of legal documents. This will quicken and automate the processing of legal documents
hence decreasing, and ultimately eliminating the backlog that currently exists throughout the legal systems. This work can be
generalized for legal appeals cases in diverse fields. Breakthroughs in the processing of these documents will decrease appeal
timeline. We compare the various configurations used to train our LSTM- RNN model along with a variety of embeddings and show
that our results obtained a higher accuracy compared to previous techniques used for semantic understanding of law related
documents.
